                <h4>"Travels"</h4>
                <p><span class="bold-text">Author:</span> Michael Crichton</p>
                <p><span class="bold-text">Description:</span> From the bestselling author of Jurassic Park, Timeline,
                    and Sphere comes a deeply personal
                    memoir full of fascinating adventures as he travels everywhere from the Mayan pyramids to
                    Kilimanjaro.

                    Fueled by a powerful curiosity—and by a need to see, feel, and hear, firsthand and close-up—Michael
                    Crichton's journeys have carried
                    him into worlds diverse and compelling—swimming with mud sharks in Tahiti, tracking wild animals
                    through the jungle of Rwanda.
                    This is a record of those travels—an exhilarating quest across the familiar and exotic frontiers of
                    the outer world, a determined
                    odyssey into the unfathomable, spiritual depths of the inner world. It is an adventure of risk and
                    rejuvenation, terror and wonder,
                    as exciting as Michael Crichton's many masterful and widely heralded works of fiction.

                    For Michael Crichton, being a Harvard-trained physician, the author of two bestsellers, and a movie
                    director is not enough.
                    It is, he resolves, time to travel. From swimming with sharks in Tahiti to psychic experiences in
                    the American desert,
                    Crichton records his exhilarating quest through the familiar and exotic frontiers of the outer
                    world....

                <p><span class="bold-text">Author:</span> Julie Kibler</p>
                <p><span class="bold-text">Description:</span> In turn-of-the-20th century Texas, the Berachah Home for
                    the Redemption and Protection
                    of Erring Girls is an unprecedented beacon of hope for young women consigned to the dangerous
                    poverty of the streets by birth,
                    ircumstance, or personal tragedy. Built in 1903 on the dusty outskirts of Arlington, a remote dot
                    between Dallas and Fort Worth's
                    red-light districts, the progressive home bucks public opinion by offering faith, training, and
                    rehabilitation to prostitutes,
                    addicts, unwed mothers, and "ruined" girls without forcibly separating mothers from children. When
                    Lizzie Bates and Mattie McBride
                    meet there--one sick and abused, but desperately clinging to her young daughter, the other jilted by
                    the beau who fathered her
                    ailing son--they form a friendship that will see them through unbearable loss, heartbreak, difficult
                    choices, and ultimately,
                    diverging paths.

                    A century later, Cate Sutton, a reclusive university librarian, uncovers the hidden histories of the
                    two troubled women as she
                    stumbles upon the cemetery on the home's former grounds and begins to comb through its archives in
                    her library. Pulled by an
                    indescribable connection, what Cate discovers about their stories leads her to confront her own
                    heartbreaking past, and to
                    reclaim the life she thought she'd let go forever. With great pathos and powerful emotional
                    resonance, Home for Erring and
                    Outcast Girls explores the dark roads that lead us to ruin, and the paths we take to return to
                    ourselves.</p>

                <p><span class="bold-text">Description:</span> From the bestselling author of What Have You Done comes a
                    mind-bending page-turner involving
                    a series of dark crimes from the past.

                    When police investigator Susan Adler is called to the roadside murder of a fellow state trooper,
                    she’s tasked with finding the people
                    responsible for the cold-blooded act caught on the trooper’s dashboard cam. The investigation takes
                    a chilling turn when people
                    involved with both the nurse and old man begin to turn up dead, and Susan enlists the help of her
                    friend and forensic investigator
                    Liam Dwyer. What started as a traffic stop gone wrong quickly unfolds into one of the darkest cases
                    of Susan’s career, and it all
                    leads to a sick, desperate killer. Susan and Liam must work fast to save the old man’s life and keep
                    future victims from the killer’s
                    grasp.</p>

                <p><span class="bold-text">Description:</span> Addison’s about to get married, but she’s not looking
                    forward to the big day.
                    It’s not her fiancé; he’s a wonderful man. It’s because Addison doesn't know who she really is. A
                    few years ago, a kind
                    driver found her bleeding next to a New Jersey highway and rescued her. While her physical wounds
                    healed, Addison’s memory
                    never returned. She doesn’t know her real name. Or how she ended up injured on the side of a road.
                    Or why she can’t shake
                    the notion that she may have done something very, very bad . . .

                    In a posh home in the Boston suburbs, Julian tries to figure out what happened to his loving, caring
                    wife, Cassandra, who
                    disappeared without a trace two years ago. She would never have left him and their seven-year-old
                    daughter Valentina of her
                    own free will—or would she?

                    As these two lives intersect, The Stranger in the Mirror hooks readers with riveting drama, told
                    with Liv Constantine’s
                    hallmark blend of glamour, tense psychological thrills, and jaw-dropping twists.</p>
