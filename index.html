                            indeed that we personally are needed.
                            Others would meet the case equally well, if not better. To all mankind they were addressed,
                            those cries for help still ringing in our
                            ears! But at this place, at this moment of time, all mankind is us, whether we like it or
                            not. Let us make the most of it, before it is
                            too late! Let us represent worthily for one the foul brood to which a cruel fate consigned
                            us! What do you say? It is true that when with
                            folded arms we weigh the pros and cons we are no less a credit to our species. The tiger
                            bounds to the help of his congeners without the
                            least reflexion, or else he slinks away into the depths of the thickets. But that is not the
                            question. What are we doing here, that is the
                            question. And we are blessed in this, that we happen to know the answer. Yes, in the immense
                            confusion one thing alone is clear.

                        We are a Dublin based literary club with a largely Irish audience but of international appeal.
                        <br><br>
                        Our core philosophy is to seek to explore the issues of contemporary novels and literature, and
                        how to use them to present the issues,
                        in a manner appropriate to our audience, of our time and place. We also want to explore novel
                        formats, culture as well as to explore novel
                        trends, such as the changing popularity of print and television, the growing influence of the
                        digital age. We believe that literary work,
                        both on our digital platform and in print, will make a significant difference to Ireland's
                        development and future. We intend to promote and
                        celebrate our literary heritage. Our work in Ireland has been praised internationally. We hope
                        that with our international reach and the right
                        encouragement we can do just that.
                        <br><br>
                        Please walk around our website for more information and to contact us.

                        Our club has been formed in 1989, by Robert McDean, in Dublin and has since helped over 40
                        writers to publish their works and reach an international
                        audience. Our original motto has been 'in love the best', and in 2007 we are finally announcing
                        our decision to run the club and help to continue to grow our community.
                        <br><br>
                        In 2009 we have received rights to use one of the large conference rooms located at the Royal
                        Dublin Society and ever since, our club has held its meeting on the premises.
                        <br><br>
                        In 2014 we have been awarded the Irish Cultural Award for our long and enriching activity,
                        together with the publishing, in the same year, of more than 12 books in Irish language.
                        "While the club is now in the process of going through a period of 'turning things around', it
                        remains to be seen how we can improve the Club and help ensure
                        that it remains up to the demands of its members." Mr McDean, former chief executive of The
                        O'Clock News, was one of the founding members of the Club.

                        One of our most important activities is helping young writers perfect their style and reach a
                        wide audience. You can send us your works through the website form,
                        on e-mail or though our Social Media platforms. Once we receive something that we find of value
                        one of our members will contact you to talk more.
                        We take all of these steps to reach out to you with a message of hope and confidence. You will
                        get a confirmation message from me when you send out the work in your
                        newsletter. It will show you that we are a great work of art and that we can fulfill an
                        important goal of delivering your work into a market that is open and accessible
                        to everyone. Your information has been used for over a year.
                        <br><br>
                        We ask for your understanding that if you want to continue on with your work, you have to feel
                        free to email me and we will work together to support you and your family.
                        You should pay attention to the fact that our message is coming from our readers. They will know
                        what we are doing because you did some research on our site before you did.
                        They will know who this work is from one of our members' friends who has a similar view on art.
                        So, you will have a chance to be a part of a creative success story,
                        as soon as you submit your work. Thank you!

                        Thank you all for your support and we hope that you have a fruitful future.
